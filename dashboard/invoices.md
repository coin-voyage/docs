# Invoices

### Invoices

CoinVoyage now supports **invoices**, allowing merchants to generate crypto payment requests directly from the dashboard. From the dashboard, you can create an invoice by entering the amount, currency, customer details, description and optionally setting a due date.

To get started, merchants first set up their **organization profile** in the dashboard, which defines their business details. Once the organization profile is configured, they can immediately begin creating invoices for their customers.

The customer automatically receives an email containing the invoice details and this payment link, making it easy for them to complete the transaction in their chosen cryptocurrency while the merchant receives settlement in their preferred currency.
