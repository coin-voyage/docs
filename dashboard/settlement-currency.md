# Settlement Currency

### Settlement Currency

The [Settlement](https://dashboard.coinvoyage.io/settlement) tab lets you define which **currency your payouts will be settled in**, regardless of the crypto asset the user pays with.&#x20;

When a user pays in any supported crypto (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.), CoinVoyage automatically **converts and settles** the funds to your chosen asset (e.g., USDT on Tron, ETH on Arbitrum). These funds are routed directly to the configured wallet without being held by CoinVoyage.
