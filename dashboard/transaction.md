# Transaction

### Transaction

Transactions record every financial activity in your CoinVoyage account.&#x20;

Use [Transactions](https://dashboard.coinvoyage.io/transactions) to view all your customer payments, including transaction hash,  value and current status. You can filter your transactions or export them if you want to use the data outside of CoinVoyage.
